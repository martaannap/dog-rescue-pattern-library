The buttons use our primary color to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose.

- The light buttons is the primary button and is used for navigation, call to action and dark background areas
- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light color
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons
